/*The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all  lines of content.
Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.
Input Format
Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.
Output Format
For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.
Sample Input
Hello world
I am a file
Read me until end-of-file.
Sample Output
1 Hello world
2 I am a file
3 Read me until end-of-file.*/


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // Scanner to read input
        
        int count = 1; // Initialize the line counter
        
        // Loop until there's no more input (EOF)
        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            String line = scanner.nextLine(); // Read the next line of input
            System.out.println(count + " " + line); // Print line number and content
            count++; // Increment the line number for the next iteration
        }
        
        scanner.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
}
